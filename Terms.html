                    <h1>Standard Business Terms and customer information</h1>
                    <p>
                        § 1 Basic provisions
                        <br /><br />
                        (1) The following business terms are applicable to all the contracts, which you conclude with us
                        as a supplier (Müjdeci GmbH) via the www.amseen.com website. Unless otherwise agreed upon, the
                        inclusion, if necessary, of your own conditions is ruled out.
                        <br /><br />
                        (2) A ‘consumer’ in the sense of the following regulations is every natural person who concludes
                        a legal transaction which, to an overwhelming extent, cannot be attributed to either his
                        commercial or independent professional activities. The term ‘businessman’ refers to every
                        natural person, legal person or legally responsible partnership that concludes a legal
                        transaction in pursuance of his/its independent professional or commercial activity.
                        <br /><br />
                        § 2 Conclusion of the contract
                        <br /><br />
                        (1) The subject-matter of the contract is the selling of products .
                        <br /><br />
                        (2) On placing the product in question on our website, we provide you with a binding offer to
                        conclude a sales agreement subject to the conditions specified in the item description.
                        <br /><br />
                        (3) The purchase agreement takes place via the online shopping cart system as follows: The
                        products intended for purchase are moved to the "shopping cart". You can select the shopping
                        cart using the appropriate buttons on the navigation bar and make changes there at any time.
                        After calling up the “Checkout” page and entering the required personal data and payment and
                        shipping conditions, all order information is then displayed again on the order summary page. If
                        you used an instant payment system (e.g. PayPal / PayPal Express, Amazon-Payments, Sofort) to
                        initiate payments, you will either be guided to our online shop on the order summary page or
                        forwarded to the web page of the instant payment provider. If you are forwarded to the instant
                        payment system, choose and enter your details as appropriate. You will then be returned to the
                        order summary page in our online shop. Before the order is sent, you can re-check all the data,
                        change it (which can also be done via the internet browser’s ‘back’ function) or cancel the
                        purchase transaction. By clicking the "Place order in conjunction with a liability to pay”
                        button to submit the order, you declare acceptance of the order in a legally binding way by
                        which the purchase agreement takes place.
                        <br /><br />
                        (4) You are not bound by your enquiries regarding the creation of an offer that have been
                        conveyed to us. We supply you with a textual and binding offer (e.g. via e-mail), which you can
                        accept within a period of 5 days.
                        <br /><br />
                        (5) The execution of the order and the sending of all the details necessitated by the conclusion
                        of the contract take place via e-mail, in a partially-automated manner. Consequently, you have
                        to ensure that the e-mail address that you have deposited with us is the correct one, and that
                        the receipt of the respective e-mails is guaranteed. In particular, you have to ensure that the
                        respective e-mails are not blocked by a SPAM filter.
                        <br /><br />
                        § 3 Right of retention, reservation of proprietary rights
                        <br /><br />
                        (1) You can only exercise a right of retention if the situation in question involves claims
                        arising from the same contractual relationship.
                        <br /><br />
                        (2) The goods remain our property until the purchase price is paid in full.
                        <br /><br />
                        § 4 Warranty
                        <br /><br />
                        (1) The statutory warranty rights are applicable.
                        <br /><br />
                        (2) As a consumer, you are requested to promptly check the product for completeness, visible
                        defects and transport damage as soon as it is delivered, and promptly disclose your complaints
                        to us and the shipping company in writing. Even if you do not comply with this request, it shall
                        have no effect on your legal warranty claims.
                        <br /><br />
                        § 5 Choice of law, place of fulfilment, jurisdiction
                        <br /><br />
                        (1) German law shall apply. This choice of law only applies to customers if it does not result
                        in the revocation of the protection guaranteed by the mandatory provisions of the law of the
                        country in which the respective customer’s usual place of residence is located
                        (benefit-of-the-doubt principle).
                        <br /><br />
                        (2) If you are not a consumer, but a businessman, a legal entity under public law or an
                        institutional fund governed by public law, our place of business is the place of jurisdiction as
                        well as the place of fulfilment for all services that follow from the business relationships
                        that exist with us. The same condition applies to situations in which you are not associated
                        with a general place of jurisdiction in Germany or the EU, as well as situations in which the
                        place of residence or the usual place of residence is not known at the time of commencement of
                        proceedings. This has no bearing on the capacity to call upon the court associated with another
                        place of jurisdiction.
                        <br /><br />
                        (3) The provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods are
                        explicitly inapplicable.
